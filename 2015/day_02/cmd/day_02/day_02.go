--- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---

The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit and
order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and
height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which
makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier:
find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. The elves
also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.

For example:

    A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52 ft^2
    of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 ft^2.

    A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42 ft^2
    of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 ft^2.

All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of
wrapping paper should they order?
